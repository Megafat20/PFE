BACKGROUND: Obesity is a risk factor for diverticulitis. However, it remains 
unclear whether visceral fat area, a more precise measurement of abdominal fat, 
is associated with the risk of diverticulitis.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of incident and recurrent diverticulitis 
according to visceral fat area.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: The Mass General Brigham Biobank.
PATIENTS: 6,654 patients who underwent abdominal CT for clinical indications and 
had no diagnosis of diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer before 
the scan.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and skeletal 
muscle area were quantified using a deep-learning model applied to abdominal CT. 
The main exposures were z-scores of body composition metrics, normalized by age, 
sex, and race. Diverticulitis cases were defined with the ICD codes for the 
primary or admitting diagnosis from the electronic health records. The risks of 
incident diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, and recurrent 
diverticulitis requiring hospitalization according to quartiles of body 
composition metrics z-scores were estimated.
RESULTS: A higher visceral fat area z-score was associated with an increased 
risk of incident diverticulitis (multivariable HR comparing the highest versus 
lowest quartile, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.48-2.95; P for trend <.0001), complicated 
diverticulitis (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.10-5.99; P for trend = .02), and recurrence 
requiring hospitalization (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.15-6.62; P for trend = .03). The 
association between visceral fat area and diverticulitis was not materially 
different among different strata of body mass index. Subcutaneous fat area and 
skeletal muscle area were not significantly associated with diverticulitis.
LIMITATIONS: The study population was limited to individuals who underwent CT 
scans for medical indication.
CONCLUSION: Higher visceral fat area derived from CT was associated with 
incident and recurrent diverticulitis. Our findings provide insight into the 
underlying pathophysiology of diverticulitis and may have implications for 
preventive strategies. See Video Abstract.
