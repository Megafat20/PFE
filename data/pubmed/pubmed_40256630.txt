The last 2 years have marked the beginning of a golden age for natural language 
processing in medicine. The arrival of large language models (LLMs) and 
multimodal models have raised new opportunities and challenges for research and 
clinical practice. In rheumatology, a specialty rich in data and requiring 
complex decision-making, the use of these tools may transform diagnostic 
procedures, improve patient interaction and simplify data management, leading to 
more personalized and efficient healthcare outcomes. The objective of this 
article is to present an overview of the status of LLMs in the field of 
rheumatology while discussing some of the challenges ahead in this area of great 
potential.
