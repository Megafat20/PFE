OBJECTIVE: Scientific publications are essential for uncovering insights, 
testing new drugs, and informing healthcare policies. Evaluating the quality of 
these publications often involves assessing their Risk of Bias (RoB), a task 
traditionally performed by human reviewers. The goal of this work is to create a 
dataset and develop models that allow automated RoB assessment in clinical 
trials.
METHODS: We use data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) as 
ground truth to label open-access clinical trial publications from PubMed. This 
process enabled us to develop training and test datasets specifically for 
machine reading comprehension and RoB inference. Additionally, we created 
extractive (RoBInExt) and generative (RoBInGen) Transformer-based approaches to 
extract relevant evidence and classify the RoB effectively.
RESULTS: RoBIn was evaluated across various settings and benchmarked against 
state-of-the-art methods, including large language models (LLMs). In most cases, 
the best-performing RoBIn variant surpasses traditional machine learning and 
LLM-based approaches, achieving a AUROC of 0.83.
CONCLUSION: This work addresses RoB assessment in clinical trials by introducing 
RoBIn, two Transformer-based models for RoB inference and evidence retrieval, 
which outperform traditional models and LLMs, demonstrating its potential to 
improve efficiency and scalability in clinical research evaluation. We also 
introduce a public dataset that is automatically annotated and can be used to 
enable future research to enhance automated RoB assessment.
